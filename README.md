The concept of BurritoDay stems from a team of software craftsmen's desire to come to a conclusion about what to eat for lunch.

Our journey begins back at our old office, where our CEO started advocating this new Burrito place that had opened up. It wasn't the closest place and so became a bit of a special occasion for when anyone wanted to go. We would take orders for each other or venture together as a group.

Nowadays, as our team has grown and we're all working in different locations, this communal activity has become somewhat dispersed. Despite this, at least once a week, someone, somewhere will call It. 
It's "Burrito[insert-day-name-here]!"
